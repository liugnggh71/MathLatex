The sides of a triangle with positive area have lengths $4$, $6$, and $x$. The sides of a second triangle with positive area have lengths $4$, $6$, and $y$. What is the smallest positive number that is not a possible value of $|x-y|$?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 2 \qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ 4 \qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ 6 \qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 8 \qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 10$

Solution

From the triangle inequality, $2<x<10$ and $2<y<10$. $7$ can be attain by letting $x=9.1$ and $y=2.1$. However, $8=10-2$ cannot be attained. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\bold{D}}$.
