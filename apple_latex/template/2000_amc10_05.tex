Points $M$ and $N$ are the midpoints of sides $PA$ and $PB$ of $\triangle PAB$. As $P$ moves along a line that is parallel to side $AB$, how many of the four quantities listed below change?

(a) the length of the segment $MN$

(b) the perimeter of $\triangle PAB$

(c) the area of $\triangle PAB$

(d) the area of trapezoid $ABNM$

Solution
\\
(a) Clearly $AB$ does not change, and $MN=\frac{1}{2}AB$, so $MN$ doesn't change either.

(b) Obviously, the perimeter changes.

(c) The area clearly doesn't change, as both the base $AB$ and its corresponding height remain the same.

(d) The bases $AB$ and $MN$ do not change, and neither does the height, so the area of the trapezoid remains the same.

Only $1$ quantity changes, so the correct answer is $\boxed{\text{B}}$.
