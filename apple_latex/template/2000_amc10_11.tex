Two different prime numbers between $4$ and $18$ are chosen. When their sum is subtracted from their product, which of the following numbers could be obtained?

$\mathrm{(A) \ 21 } \qquad \mathrm{(B) \ 60 } \qquad \mathrm{(C) \ 119 } \qquad \mathrm{(D) \ 180 } \qquad \mathrm{(E) \ 231 }$
\\
Solution 1
\\
All prime numbers between 4 and 18 have an odd product and an even sum. Any odd number minus an even number is an odd number, so we can eliminate B and D. Since the highest two prime numbers we can pick are 13 and 17, the highest number we can make is $(13)(17)-(13+17) = 221 - 30 = 191$. Thus, we can eliminate E. Similarly, the two lowest prime numbers we can pick are 5 and 7, so the lowest number we can make is $(5)(7)-(5+7) = 23$. Therefore, A cannot be an answer. So, the answer must be $\mathrm{(C)}$.

Let the two primes be $p$ and $q$. We wish to obtain the value of $pq-(p+q)$, or $pq-p-q$. Using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we can rewrite this expression as $(1-p)(1-q) -1$ or $(p-1)(q-1) -1$. Noticing that $(13-1)(11-1) - 1 = 120-1 = 119$, we see that the answer is $\mathrm{(C)}$.
