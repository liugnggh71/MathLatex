Chandra pays an on-line service provider a fixed monthly fee plus an hourly charge for connect time. Her December bill was $\$12.48$, but in January her bill was $\$17.54$ because she used twice as much connect time as in December. What is the fixed monthly fee?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ $ $2.53 \qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ $ $5.06 \qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ $ $6.24 \qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ $ $7.42 \qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ $ $8.77$
\\
Solution
\\
Let $x$ be the fixed fee, and $y$ be the amount she pays for the minutes she used in the first month.

$x+y=12.48$

$x+2y=17.54$

$y=5.06$

$x=7.42$

We want the fixed fee, which is $\boxed{\text{D}}$
